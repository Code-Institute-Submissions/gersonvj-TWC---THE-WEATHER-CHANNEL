<h1>TWC - The Weather Channel</h1>

<img src="assets/wireframes/mockup2.jpg" style="margin: 0;">

Welcome,

For my Milestone 2 Project with [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/), I had the challenge to incorporate a website using JavaScript. I decided to create a weather channel to make a interactive API to bring the latest online weather and news for the users.
The channel broadcasts weather forecasts and weather-related news, along with a newsletter. The rapidAPI update the information of the weather and weather-related news.

# Ux Structure

## Website Goals

<ul>
 <li>As the user opens the home page, will see a jumbotrom that highlights the page the user is into. With four cards having a brief describle of the cities and a button that open a popup card to show some weather information of the city connected via API.</li>
 <li>Our latest news are conected via API aswell showing the last 4 weather-related news with a "Read More" link to the user see the news from the original website.</li>
 <li>The newsletter is a emailJS that send to the user a email with the temperature of the cities (not connected with an API).</li>
</ul>

## User Stories

   * I want to go onto a responsive page with minimal loading time.
   * I want to go onto a page and understand what sort of content is available.
   * I want an easy and accessable navigation menu.
   * I want to know what is the weather in these cities.
   * I want to know more about wheater with online news.
   * I want to be able to read more about the news showing in the page.
   * I want to receive a email with the weather of these cities.
   * I want the other useful information including social media links.

## Wireframes
I created some wireframes to get an understanding of how I wanted to present the website on view. This way I could improve it where necessary or find alternate ways to produce a better product.

Links to Wireframes
I have uploaded my Wireframes up into the Wireframes Repository directory: https://github.com/gersonvj/TWC---THE-WEATHER-CHANNEL/tree/master/assets/wireframes.
There are 4 files in there:
 * [indextwc.jpg](https://github.com/gersonvj/TWC---THE-WEATHER-CHANNEL/blob/master/assets/wireframes/indextwc.jpg) shows the ideia for the main page. 
 * [newstwc.jpg](https://github.com/gersonvj/TWC---THE-WEATHER-CHANNEL/blob/master/assets/wireframes/newstwc.jpg) is a mockup of the presenteation of the news page.
 * [newslettertwc.jpg](https://github.com/gersonvj/TWC---THE-WEATHER-CHANNEL/blob/master/assets/wireframes/newslettertwc.jpg) is the wireframe for the newsletter page.
 * [first example twc.pdf](https://github.com/gersonvj/TWC---THE-WEATHER-CHANNEL/blob/master/assets/wireframes/first%20example%20twc.pdf) is the main concept used to develop the TWC website.

# Testing

W3C Validator was used to validate all my code and outline any errors. https://validator.w3.org/

Chrome Dev Tools was used to test out my code and be able to make adjustments. This was a constant use of mine throughout my development. https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools

JSHint was used to test out my JavaScript. https://jshint.com/

<ul>
<li>05/11/2020 - Not reponsive for phone devices, background pictures for jumbotrom not working, h1 headers need more margin.</li>
